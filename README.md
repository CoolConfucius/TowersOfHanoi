# TowersOfHanoi

Begins with three stacks: the first one full with ordered disks and the other two empty. User can only move the top disk of a stack to the top of another stack. No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk. User wins by moving all the disks to the third stack. Has a reset button. Can toggle the difficulty level (number of disks to play with).
